\section*{pruner\+: Implementing the Felsenstein\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{classTree}{Tree} Pruning algorithm}

This C++ template library provides classes to implement Felsenstein tree-\/pruning algorithm for efficiently computing likelihood functions on phylogenies.

The library reads in a tree object in the form of {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$ unsigned int $>$} specifying the source and target of each dyad (edge) and allows the user to store arbitrary arguments using memory pointers, and {\ttfamily std\+::function} to be called with those arbitrary arguments and tree structure data.

Trees are stored as two lists\+: each nodes\textquotesingle{} offspring, and each nodes\textquotesingle{} parents, which can be accessed at any point using {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classTreeIterator}{Tree\+Iterator}} class that implements tree traversals (pre and post order for pruning).
